# calendar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The commit `8c509` marks the latest commit to deploy the application with the minimal code in order to make it work as expected by the challenge. It took me **6 and half hours to complete**. At this point the application can be found at: [calendar app firebase hosting](https://calendar-ba134.firebaseapp.com/)

## Requirements uncommpleted

_All requirements has been completed including the extra credit about holidays_

## Tecnhical Debt

Answering the _"bugs you’ve identified but didn’t have time to fix"_ I can mention that the application run slower than expected whenever the load of the holidays is refer to. Other than that, I was quite on top of the maximum time and everything seems to work as expected but I couldn't make any deeper analisys.

## Things you would do if you had more time to complete the task

* I would add tests to the application, in fact, I would try to avoid to develop without any test workflow in front
* I would use env variables so the API tokens wouldn't be exposed (token used to consume the holidays API)
* I would make a deeper check about performance use `PureComponent` whenever is possible and overall analysis of the application
* Depending of the nature of the application we may need to split the components folders into features and make sort of branches similars to the structure show at this point to support daily and yearly canlendar modes.
* I would add a way for the user to know the holiday details for each day
* I would add aesthetic details :nails:
